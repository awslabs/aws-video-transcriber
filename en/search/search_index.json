The solution includes the following functions: Generating captions: supports uploading MP4, MOV and MKV videos; supports videos within four hours according to Amazon Transcribe Restriction . Editing captions: supports proofreading, editing, paragraph splitting and merging, mapping, and replacement of captions. Translating captions: supports translation from the source language to the target language. Currently, this is only supported by the deployment in AWS Standard Regions. Downloading captions: supports SRT or WEBVTT. Burning captions: supports burning generated captions into videos, and then downloading the videos with captions. The Video Transcriber solution is intended for customers with video caption processing requirements in industries like education or media. Specifically, customers can use the solution to generate video captions precisely or translate video captions with lower cost and higher efficiency. This implementation guide describes architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying the Video Transcriber solution in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It includes links to CloudFormation templates that launch and configure the AWS services required to deploy this solution using AWS best practices for security and availability. The guide is intended for IT architects, developers, DevOps professionals, data scientists, and algorithm engineers with practical experience architecting in the AWS Cloud.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"additional-resources/","text":"Amazon S3 Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda Amazon DynamoDB AWS Elemental MediaConvert Amazon Transcribe Amazon Translate","title":"Additional resources"},{"location":"architecture/","text":"Deploying this solution with the default parameters builds the following environment in the AWS Cloud. Figure: Solution Architecture This solution deploys the Amazon CloudFormation template in your AWS Cloud account and completes the following settings. Amazon S3 (Web App) stores front-end static files. Client side sends the request through Amazon API Gateway . AWS Lambda Function receives the request from Amazon API Gateway, and process the business logic. Client side gets the pre-signed URL from AWS Lambda, then uploads the video to be processed. AWS Lambda Function gets/updates videos' profile from Amazon DynamoDB . AWS Lambda Function invokes AWS Elemental MediaConvert to process video, which includes extracting audio from video and burning captions into video and stores the result into Amazon S3 (Videos). AWS Lambda Function invokes Amazon Transcribe captions from audio and store the result into Amazon S3 (Captions). AWS Lambda Function invokes Amazon Translate to translate captions to another language and stores the result into Amazon S3 (Captions). The solution deploys a Web application into Amazon S3 bucket, and the resources in Amazon S3 can only be accessed through Amazon CloudFront. Amazon API Gateway authenticates through API Key, and clients must enter the correct API Key to access Amazon API Gateway.","title":"Architecture overview"},{"location":"cost/","text":"You are responsible for the cost of using Amazon Web Service's services used while running this solution. As of December 2021, the cost of the solution varies depending on: The number of requests to Amazon API Gateway The number of times AWS Lambda is invoked The number of Amazon DynamoDB reads/writes The number of videos processed by AWS Elemental MediaConvert. The solution uses AWS Elemental MediaConvert to extract audios from videos or burn captions into videos. The number of audios that Amazon Transcribe processed. The solution uses Amazon Transcribe to extract text from audio and generate captions. The number of captions characters that Amazon Translate processed. The solution uses Amazon Translate to translate the captions to another language. Currently, this is only supported by the deployment in AWS Standard Regions.
