Figure: Solution Architecture

This solution deploys the Amazon CloudFormation template in your AWS Cloud account and completes the following settings.

1. [Amazon S3][s3] (Web App) stores front-end static files
2. Client side sends the request through [Amazon API Gateway][api-gateway]
3. [AWS Lambda][lambda] Function receives the request from Amazon API Gateway, and process the business logic
4. Client side gets the signURL from AWS Lambda, then uploads the video to be processed
5. AWS Lambda Function gets/updates videos' profile from [Amazon DynamoDB][dynamodb]
6. AWS Lambda Function invokes [AWS Elemental MediaConvert][mediaconvert] to process video，which includes extracting audio from video and burning captions into video and stores the result into Amazon S3 (Videos)
7. AWS Lambda Function invokes [Amazon Transcribe][transcribe] captions from audio and store the result into Amazon S3 (Captions)
8. AWS Lambda Function invokes [Amazon Translate][translate] to translate captions to another language and stores the result into Amazon S3 (Captions)

The solution deploys a Web application into Amazon S3 bucket，and the resources in Amazon S3 can only be accessed through Amazon CloudFront。

Amazon API Gateway authenticates through API Key, and clients must enter the correct API Key to access Amazon API Gateway.
