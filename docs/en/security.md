When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate.
