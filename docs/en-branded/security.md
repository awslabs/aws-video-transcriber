When you build systems on Amazon Web Services infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and Amazon Web Services. This [shared model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because Amazon Web Services operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate.
