**Time to deploy**: Approximately 10 minutes

## Deployment overview

Use the following steps to deploy this solution on Amazon Web Services.

- Step 1: Launch the Amazon CloudFormation template into your Amazon account
    - Launch CloudFormation tempalte in Amazon Web Services China Regions 
    - Launch CloudFormation template in Amazon Web Services Standard Regions
- Step 2: Access the web interface 
- Step 3: Upload videos and perform operations related to video captions

## Step 1: Launch the Amazon CloudFormation template

This automatic Amazon CloudFormation template deploys the solution in Amazon Web Services.

### Launch CloudFormation tempalte in Amazon Web Services China Regions

**Prerequisites**

1. Make sure a domain registered by ICP is available. Because the CloudFront address in Amazon China Regions cannot be accessed directly, this domain name will be used as a CNAME to point to the CloudFront address created after the solution is deployed, and you can access the solution through this domain.
2. Make sure a domain hosting zone is available. If you havenâ€™t created a hosted zone, please refer to [Use hosted zone][hostedzone].

**Launch Amazon CloudFormation template**

1. Log in to the Amazon Web Services management console, select [Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) Region operated by Sinnet][template-china1] or [Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) Region operated by NWCD][template-china2] to launch Amazon CloudFormation template.

2. The template will be launched in the default region after you log in to the console. Please select from the region drop-down list in the console navigation bar to switch to other regions if you need to change the region.

3. On the **Create stack** page, confirm that the correct template URL is displayed in the Amazon S3 URL text box, and then choose **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a unique name in your account that meets the naming requirements for your solution stack.

5. In the **Parameters** section, view the parameters of the solution template and modify as needed, and then choose **Next**.

    |  Parameter Name   |  Default Value |  Description |
    |  ----------  | ---------| -----------  |
    | **APIKey**  | N/A  | Enter the authentication information required to log in to the web interface after the deployment.|
    | **TranscribeLanguage**    | zh-CN    | Select the default caption processing language. Currently, it supports en-AU, en-US, en-GB, es-US, en-IN, de-DE, hi-IN, pt-BR, pt-PT, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, ta-IN, te-IN, zh-CN, ja-JP, ko-KR, ar-AE and ar-SA. Refer to [Amazon Transcribe][transcribe-support-language] to learn more about supported language and language code. |

6. On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the settings. Check the box acknowledging that the tempalte creates Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

8. Choose **Create stack** to deploy the stack.

You can check the status of the stack in the **Status** column of the Amazon CloudFormation console. You should receive a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status in approximately 10 minutes.

**Create records on Route53 to resolve domain names**

1. Log in to Route53 Console, and choose **Create record**.

2. Enter the required subdomain in **Record name** text box. The suffix is the top-level domain registered by ICP, for example, video-transctiber.ch.test.com.

3. Choose **Record type** as CNAME.

4. Enter the CloudFront URL into **Value** text box, not including https://. For example: xxxxxx.cloudfront.cn. 

    You can get CloudFront URL from the solution Amazon CloudFormation stack **Outputs** page.

5. Choose **Create records**.

**Configure CNAME in the CloudFront**

1. Log in to CloudFront Console, and choose **Distributions** of this solution.

2. Choose **Edit** to enter the **Edit settings**.

3. Choose **Add item**, then enter domain name in **Alternate domain name (CNAME)** text box. For example, video-transctiber.ch.test.com.

4. Choose **Save changes**. The configuration take effect upon the automatic CloudFront deployment.

### Launch CloudFormation tempalte in Amazon Standard Regions

**Launch Amazon CloudFormation template**

1. Log in to the Amazon Web Services management console, select [Global region][template-global] to to launch Amazon CloudFormation template.

2. The template will be launched in the default region after you log in to the console. Please select from the region drop-down list in the console navigation bar to switch to other regions if you need to change the region.

3. On the **Create stack** page, confirm that the correct template URL is displayed in the Amazon S3 URL text box, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a unique name in your account that meets the naming requirements for your solution stack.

5. In the **Parameters** section, view the parameters of the solution template and modify as needed, and then select **Next**.

    |  Parameter Name   |  Default Value |  Description |
    |  ----------  | ---------| -----------  |
    | **APIKey**  | N/A  | Enter the authentication information required to log in to the web interface after the deployment.|
    | **TranscribeLanguage**    | zh-CN    | Select the default caption processing language. Currently, it supports en-AU, en-US, en-GB, es-US, en-IN, de-DE, hi-IN, pt-BR, pt-PT, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, ta-IN, te-IN, zh-CN, ja-JP, ko-KR, ar-AE and ar-SA. Refer to [Amazon Transcribe][transcribe-support-language] to learn more about supported language and language code. |

6. On the **Configure stack options** page, select **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, Check the box acknowledging that the tempalte creates Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

8. Choose **Create stack** to deploy the stack.

You can check the status of the stack in the **Status** column of the Amazon CloudFormation console. You should receive a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status in approximately 10 minutes.

## Step 2: Access the web interface

After the stack is successfully created, you can view the authentication information (**APIKey**) required to access the web interface and the created CloudFront URL (**ConsoleUrl**) on the **Outputs** tab of Amazon CloudFormation stack.

Depending on the region where you create the stack, you can choose to access the web interface from the Amazon Web Services China Regions or the Amazon Web Services Standard Regions.
